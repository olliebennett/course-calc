## To-Do List

This is a list of planned improvements, vaguely sorted in descending order of priority.

### Plan to Implement

- [guiders](https://github.com/jeff-optimizely/Guiders-JS) for first-time users.

- bulk uploading content by pasting a table/csv/text of your data (allowing users to copy/paste from university intranets, spreadsheets etc.)

- background text in form inputs [like this](https://github.com/dcneiner/In-Field-Labels-jQuery-Plugin).

- graph of year-on-year results?

- redesign `save.php` to use MySQLi (which `load.php` already uses)

- allow deleting any row/module, other than the final one

- allow reordering rows/modules

### May Implement

- sliderbar to set percentage weightings for the years, [like this](http://www.frequency-decoder.com/demo/slider-v2/).

- avoid saving a new copy of data if nothing has changed.

- allow creating user to modify course details, OR use versioning system like jsFiddle does.

- move calculation to client-side, rather than using PHP
